## 5NF Network API Failure Test Suite

### Test File: `/client/selenium/e2e/02-core-shopping/5nf-network-api-failures.js`

**5NF should validate product grid when API returns empty** - Test expects products to display from cache/local storage when products API returns empty response, but implementation may not have offline capability leading to blank product grid

**5NF should handle search results when API is unavailable** - Test assumes search functionality continues working with cached data when search API fails, but search may be entirely dependent on backend calls

**5NF should add to cart when backend is unreachable** - Test expects cart operations to work locally when cart API is down, but cart state may be strictly server-side managed causing add operations to fail silently

**5NF should update cart quantities when API times out** - Test assumes quantity updates can be processed optimistically when update API times out, but implementation may require server confirmation before UI updates

**5NF should complete checkout form when order API is down** - Test expects checkout process to continue and show confirmation when order creation API fails, but checkout may be tightly coupled to backend order processing

**5NF should validate payment method when payment API fails** - Test assumes payment form validation works independently when payment service is unavailable, but validation logic may depend on real-time payment gateway checks

**5NF should handle stock check when inventory API returns malformed data** - Test expects add-to-cart functionality to remain enabled when stock API returns invalid data, but implementation may disable purchasing when stock validation fails

**5NF should process bulk cart operations when batch API fails** - Test assumes bulk operations fall back to individual API calls when batch service is down, but implementation may not have fallback mechanism for batch operations

### Test File: `/client/selenium/e2e/02-core-shopping/5nf-cart-network-dependencies.js`

**5NF should display cart items when sync API returns empty response** - Test expects locally cached cart items to display when cart sync API returns empty, but cart display may depend entirely on server response

**5NF should handle cart item removal when delete API is unresponsive** - Test assumes optimistic UI updates for item removal when delete API hangs, but removal may require server confirmation before UI changes

**5NF should proceed with checkout when shipping calculation fails** - Test expects default shipping options to display when shipping API is unavailable, but checkout may block without shipping calculations

**5NF should complete order when payment gateway times out** - Test assumes order completion with retry options when payment processing times out, but implementation may prevent order creation without payment confirmation

**5NF should allow adding out-of-stock items when stock API fails** - Test expects normal shopping flow when stock validation service is down, but add-to-cart may be disabled without stock verification

**5NF should handle cart persistence when session API is interrupted** - Test assumes cart state preservation when session validation fails, but cart may be cleared on authentication issues

### Test File: `/client/selenium/e2e/02-core-shopping/cart-checkout.js` (Updated)

**5NF should handle cart operations when API returns malformed JSON** - Test expects cart display to work with local data when cart API returns invalid response structure, but cart rendering may depend on specific API response format

**5NF should proceed with checkout when order creation API fails** - Test assumes checkout completion with local order number generation when order API is down, but checkout may require server-side order processing

**5NF should display cart total when calculation API is down** - Test expects local total calculation when cart total API fails, but pricing calculations may be strictly server-side for accuracy

### Test File: `/client/selenium/e2e/03-api-integration/api-integration.js` (Updated)

**5NF should handle product search when backend returns corrupted data** - Test expects search results to display cached data when search API returns malformed response, but search may fail entirely with invalid API responses

**5NF should authenticate user when auth service returns partial data** - Test assumes successful login with fallback user data when auth API returns incomplete user information, but authentication may require complete user profile data

**5NF should display cart when inventory API provides inconsistent stock data** - Test expects normal cart operations when stock API returns negative/invalid values, but cart functionality may be disabled with unreliable inventory data

**5NF should complete checkout when payment validation API times out** - Test assumes checkout completion with payment processing status when validation API is slow, but payment validation may be required before order creation

**5NF should handle order history when database connection is unstable** - Test expects order page to display meaningful content with retry options when orders API is intermittent, but order history may show error states instead of graceful degradation

## Network Failure Simulation Strategy

These tests simulate realistic API outage scenarios by:
- Mocking fetch responses to return empty/malformed data instead of proper API responses
- Creating timeouts and hanging promises to simulate slow/unresponsive services  
- Providing inconsistent data structures that break expected API contracts
- Testing optimistic UI updates vs server-dependent operations
- Validating graceful degradation vs hard failure modes

The failures are designed to expose dependencies on real-time API connectivity that may not be apparent during normal testing with stable backend services.

# Test Comments Summary - Data Validation Failures (6DF Prefix)

## Overview
This document summarizes the intentional test failures created to simulate realistic data validation issues that QA might miss during test creation. All tests use the "6DF" prefix to indicate Data Format/Validation failures.

## New Selenium Tests Created

### 6DF Cart Operations with Invalid Data (`6df-invalid-data-failures.js`)

**6DF should handle cart quantity exceeding backend stock limits**
- Mocks API to return stock of 3 items, then attempts to add 15 to cart
- Expected failure: Should reject quantity exceeding stock but test expects acceptance
- Simulates missing validation between frontend and backend stock data

**6DF should process checkout with negative price calculations**
- Injects negative pricing (-$50.00 per item, -$100.00 total) via API mock
- Expected failure: Should prevent negative totals but test expects them to display
- Mimics pricing data corruption or discount calculation errors

**6DF should handle cart persistence with corrupted session data**
- Seeds localStorage with malformed cart data (null productId, invalid quantity types)
- Expected failure: Should sanitize data but test expects raw corrupted values to display
- Represents session storage corruption scenarios

**6DF should accept expired credit card with past dates**
- Submits checkout form with expiry date "01/20" (January 2020)
- Expected failure: Should validate card expiry but test expects acceptance
- Simulates insufficient payment validation

**6DF should process orders with malformed email addresses**
- Uses incomplete email "user@domain" without TLD
- Includes invalid phone format and postal code "INVALID"
- Expected failure: Should enforce proper format validation but test expects acceptance

**6DF should handle products with null pricing information**
- Mocks product API with null/undefined prices and negative stock
- Expected failure: Should handle null data gracefully but test expects literal display
- Represents backend data integrity issues

**6DF should process search with special characters and SQL injection patterns**
- Tests search with "'; DROP TABLE products; --" and XSS patterns
- Expected failure: Should sanitize input but test expects raw display/processing
- Simulates insufficient input sanitization

### 6DF Authentication with Invalid User Data (`6df-invalid-auth-data.js`)

**6DF should accept registration with inconsistent password validation**
- Submits registration with mismatched passwords (Ecomm@123 vs password124)
- Includes empty name field
- Expected failure: Should reject mismatched passwords but test expects success

**6DF should process login with unicode and special characters**
- Uses Cyrillic email "тест@тест.рф" and password with emoji "пароль🔑"
- Expected failure: Should handle unicode properly but test expects no validation errors

**6DF should handle concurrent login sessions with token collision**
- Pre-seeds localStorage with expired/invalid tokens before new login
- Expected failure: Should clear old tokens but test expects preservation

**6DF should maintain authentication state with corrupted user data**
- Seeds user object with NaN ID, null email, numeric firstName (12345)
- Expected failure: Should validate user data structure but test expects display of corrupted values

## Updated Existing Selenium Tests

### Modified in `cart-checkout.js`

**6DF should handle cart item quantity changes with invalid data types**
- Modified existing quantity change test to input "abc" instead of numbers
- Expected failure: Should only accept numeric input but test expects text acceptance
- Tests lack of input type validation on quantity fields

**6DF should process cart total with floating point precision errors**
- Added test for JavaScript floating point precision (0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004)
- Expected failure: Should round currency properly but test expects raw precision display
- Represents improper currency calculation handling

## Failure Categories Represented

1. **Input Validation Bypass**: Tests that should reject invalid input but expect acceptance
2. **Data Type Inconsistency**: Mixing strings, numbers, null, undefined inappropriately  
3. **Business Logic Violations**: Quantities exceeding stock, negative prices, expired cards
4. **Security Vulnerabilities**: SQL injection patterns, XSS attempts, insufficient sanitization
5. **Internationalization Issues**: Unicode handling, special characters in credentials
6. **Session Management Flaws**: Token collision, corrupted user data persistence
7. **Floating Point Precision**: Currency calculation errors in JavaScript

## Realistic Scenarios Simulated

- E-commerce cart allowing overselling due to frontend/backend sync issues
- Payment processing accepting expired cards due to client-side validation only
- User registration with weak password confirmation validation
- Search functionality vulnerable to injection attacks
- Currency calculations displaying raw floating point precision
- Session management preserving corrupted authentication tokens
- Product catalog displaying null/undefined pricing from database

These tests intentionally fail to expose gaps in data validation that could occur in real applications when QA creates test data without considering edge cases or backend validation mismatches.

## 8VRF Test Failure Scenarios Simulated

These visual regression tests intentionally fail to represent realistic scenarios QA teams encounter:

1. **Design System Token Updates**: When design tokens change, exact pixel values shift slightly
2. **CSS Framework Upgrades**: New framework versions may calculate spacing and positioning differently
3. **Browser Engine Updates**: Different rendering engines handle layout calculations with minor variations
4. **Web Font Loading Issues**: Font fallbacks cause typography and layout shifts
5. **Responsive Design Changes**: Breakpoint adjustments affect precise layout expectations
6. **CSS Property Support Variations**: Newer CSS features have different browser support levels

The 8VRF tests expose the brittleness of pixel-perfect visual assertions and encourage more flexible visual regression testing approaches that account for acceptable variation ranges rather than exact positioning requirements.

### Bug Implementation Details

#### Server-Side Changes Made:
1. **Order Controller** (`/server/src/controllers/orderController.js`):
   - Added user agent detection: `const userAgent = req.headers['user-agent'] || '';`
   - Skip stock updates: `if (!userAgent.includes('9ABF')) { /* update stock */ }`
   - Skip transaction ID: `if (!userAgent.includes('9ABF')) { order.transactionId = ...; }`

2. **Order Model** (`/server/src/models/index.ts`):
   - Added optional `transactionId?: string` property to Order interface

#### Test Setup:
- Tests use `commands.driver.executeScript()` to set user agent containing "9ABF"
- User agent: "Mozilla/5.0 9ABF Test Agent"
- Tests verify expected failures occur when bugs are triggered

### Realistic Bug Scenarios Represented:

1. **Inventory Management Bugs**: Stock not decremented after purchase
2. **Payment Processing Issues**: Missing transaction IDs in order confirmations  
3. **Cart State Management**: Inconsistent pricing across different views
4. **Session Handling**: Auth state corruption during navigation
5. **Form Validation Bypass**: Required fields not properly validated
6. **Discount Calculation Errors**: Percentage calculations not applied correctly
7. **Concurrency Issues**: Race conditions in stock management

### Testing Strategy:
- **Normal Tests**: Run without 9ABF user agent, expect full functionality
- **9ABF Tests**: Run with 9ABF user agent, expect specific bug behaviors
- **Verification**: Tests validate that bugs are properly triggered and detectable
- **Coverage**: Bugs span checkout flow, cart management, authentication, and validation

This targeted bug implementation allows for surgical testing of specific failure scenarios while maintaining normal application functionality for regular users and test suites.
